* Regret: <https://youtu.be/N5x48g2sp8M?t=114>
  * why do we talk about regret instead of just maximizing the total accumulative reward?
  * inverse-propensity weighting to get unbiased estimates: <https://youtu.be/N5x48g2sp8M?t=2438>
  * epsilon-greedy for stochastic settings
  * Exp4 for non-stochastic (adversarial) settings
